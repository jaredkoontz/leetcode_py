    the basic intuition is to use bitwise operations to sum the two numbers

    XOR (^) works like an addition without a carry:
    0 + 0 = 0
    0 + 1 = 1
    1 + 0 = 1
    1 + 1 = 0 (carry needed)
    AND (&) finds where both bits are 1 â€” the positions that need a carry.
    Left shift (<<) moves the carry to the next higher bit position
