        Approach 1: Brute Force

        Intuition:
        The obvious brute force solution is to pick all possible starting and ending positions for a substring and verify if it is a palindrome.
        There are a total of n^2 such substrings (excluding the trivial solution where a character itself is a palindrome).
        Since verifying each substring takes O(n) time, the run time complexity is O(n^3).

        Algorithm:
        1. Pick a starting index for the current substring which is every index from 0 to n-2.
        2. Now, pick the ending index for the current substring which is every index from i+1 to n-1.
        3. Check if the substring from ith index to jth index is a palindrome.
        4. If step 3 is true and length of substring is greater than maximum length so far, update maximum length and maximum substring.
        5. Print the maximum substring.

        Approach 2: Expand Around Center

        Intuition:
        To enumerate all palindromic substrings of a given string, we expand the string at each possible starting and ending position of a palindrome,
        and keep track of the length of the longest palindrome found.

        Approach:
        - A palindrome mirrors around its center. A palindrome can be expanded from its center, and there are only 2n - 1 such centers.
        - There are 2n - 1 centers because a palindrome's center can be between two letters, which gives rise to even-length palindromes.

        Algorithm:
        1. Initialize max_str = s[0] and max_len = 1.
        2. Iterate over the string. For each character:
           - Expand around it for odd-length palindromes.
           - Expand between it and the next character for even-length palindromes.
        3. Track the maximum length and substring.

        Approach 3: Dynamic Programming

        Intuition:
        To improve over brute force, avoid unnecessary re-computation when validating palindromes.
        Example: If "bab" is a palindrome, then "ababa" is also a palindrome if the outer letters match.

        Algorithm:
        1. Initialize a boolean table dp[n][n] = False.
        2. Set dp[i][i] = True for all i (every character is a palindrome).
        3. Iterate over the string:
           - For each i, for each j < i:
             - If s[j] == s[i] and (i-j <= 2 or dp[j+1][i-1]):
                 - Mark dp[j][i] = True

        Approach 4: Manacher's Algorithm

        Intuition:
        Use palindrome properties to avoid unnecessary validations.
        Maintain a center and right boundary, using previously calculated values to determine if we can expand.
        Track max_len and max_str throughout.

        Algorithm:
        1. Transform the string by inserting '#' between characters and at ends.
        2. Initialize dp array, center, right boundary.
